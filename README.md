# Churn-Rate-Machine-Learning
This project is created by 4 students: Vu Truong, Quang Huynh, Anh Ngo, Thanh Nguyen at SP Jain School of Global Management for the purpose of learning fundamental Machine Learning. This is our first project about ML, which we hope it would be an important premise for us to build more larger projects in the future.
